## Meeting 1: Background Research 
As a team we have decided on pursuing the project that was pitched by Professor Gruev which was the antweight battlebot competition. It seemed like a lot of fun as we have all watched the battlebots show before and this would be like a smaller version of the real competition. I have also competed in a similar competion but I created a 3lb robot, so this would be very similar in some ways. There were a few major differences between the competition I competed in, and the comeptition that Professor Gruev is hosting.
1. The robots will have a maximum weight of 2lbs
2. All parts must be 3D printed out of PLA, PLA+, PETG, or ABS.
3. All PCBs must be custom and cant utilize any off the shelf ESCs
4. Must use a Microcontroller inside of the robot that will communicate with a computer via bluetooth or wifi
5. Maximum voltage is limited to 16V

After reading the rules, we realized that there are three main components for this project, the phsyical design of the robot, the ESCs that will power the motors, and the Microcontroller and communication with the robot. Given our strengths and previous experience, we split up the three parts where I will work on the robot design, Keegan will work on the software, and Avik will work on the PCB's, but we will all help out with other parts when possible and help is needed to meet deadlines.
