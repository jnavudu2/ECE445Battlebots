## Meeting 1: Background Research <a name="m1"></a>
As a team we have decided on pursuing the project that was pitched by Professor Gruev which was the antweight battlebot competition. It seemed like a lot of fun as we have all watched the battlebots show before and this would be like a smaller version of the real competition. I have also competed in a similar competion but I created a 3lb robot, so this would be very similar in some ways. There were a few major differences between the competition I competed in, and the comeptition that Professor Gruev is hosting.
1. The robots will have a maximum weight of 2lbs
2. All parts must be 3D printed out of PLA, PLA+, PETG, or ABS.
3. All PCBs must be custom and cant utilize any off the shelf ESCs
4. Must use a Microcontroller inside of the robot that will communicate with a computer via bluetooth or wifi
5. Maximum voltage is limited to 16V
